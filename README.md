# Simple-Python-Game
In this project, i built a a simple game in Python using Pygame package, called Rectangle game.
The aim of the game is to move from side to side and up and down in order to avoid squares that fall from the ceiling, to reach a score as high as possible. As time goes on, the speed of the squares increases.
